In your setup, you're starting three different components, each serving a distinct purpose but working together to handle different types of communication:

### 1. **HTTP Server (Express + Node.js)**:
   - **Purpose**: The core web server that handles **HTTP requests**, such as standard API requests, file serving, and routing. 
   - **In your code**: The `httpServer` is created using `createServer(app)` (where `app` is the Express instance). This is the server that listens on a port for incoming HTTP requests.
   - **Responsibilities**: 
     - Handles RESTful routes.
     - Serves static files.
     - Applies middleware (e.g., authentication, body parsing).
     - Handles the GraphQL HTTP requests (through Apollo).

   ```ts
   const httpServer = createServer(app);
   ```

   - **Example**: If you visit a URL like `http://localhost:4000/`, the HTTP server is the one responding.

### 2. **Apollo Server (GraphQL Server)**:
   - **Purpose**: This server handles **GraphQL queries and mutations**. It works with the HTTP server to process requests sent to `/graphql` but requires a specialized setup to interpret GraphQL queries.
   - **In your code**: The Apollo server (`new ApolloServer({ ... })`) handles the parsing and execution of GraphQL operations. It needs to be applied to your Express app using `server.applyMiddleware({ app })`.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Executes GraphQL queries and mutations.
     - Provides a context for each request (for authentication, user data, etc.).
     - Uses the HTTP server to transport the GraphQL queries over HTTP (or WebSocket for subscriptions).
   
   ```ts
   const server = new ApolloServer({
     schema,
     context: async ({ req }) => { /* Context auth logic */ },
   });
   
   server.applyMiddleware({ app });
   ```

   - **Example**: When you send a GraphQL query like:
     ```graphql
     query {
       getUser(id: "123") {
         name
         email
       }
     }
     ```
     The Apollo Server handles interpreting this query and interacts with your database and resolvers.

### 3. **WebSocket Server (GraphQL Subscriptions + Real-Time Communication)**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles **WebSocket connections** for real-time communication, such as GraphQL subscriptions or notifications.
   - **In your code**: The WebSocket server (`new WebSocketServer({ ... })`) allows persistent connections between the client and server, enabling real-time updates. This WebSocket server is linked to the `httpServer` (which serves as the underlying transport layer).
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Manages persistent WebSocket connections for real-time updates.
     - Provides the `useServer` utility to handle GraphQL subscriptions.
     - Supports real-time data (e.g., notifications, chat messages, or live data).

   ```ts
   const wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
     server: httpServer, // Reuses the HTTP server for WebSocket connections
     path: '/graphql',   // Defines the path for WebSocket connections
   });
   ```

   - **Example**: When a user subscribes to a GraphQL subscription:
     ```graphql
     subscription {
       messageSent {
         content
         user {
           name
         }
       }
     }
     ```
     The WebSocket server keeps the connection open and sends new data whenever it's available, in real-time.

### **How They're Related**:
1. **HTTP Server as a Base**: The `httpServer` is the core server, and both the Apollo and WebSocket servers rely on it for transport.
   - **Apollo Server** uses the HTTP server to serve GraphQL requests over HTTP.
   - **WebSocket Server** uses the HTTP server for WebSocket connections, but they operate on different paths (`/graphql` for HTTP and WebSocket connections).

2. **Separate Protocols**:
   - **HTTP** (via Express and Apollo) is used for traditional request/response patterns like API requests or GraphQL queries/mutations.
   - **WebSocket** (via the WebSocketServer) is used for persistent, real-time communication, like subscriptions or real-time messaging. WebSocket connections are long-lived, whereas HTTP requests are short-lived.

3. **Why Multiple Servers?**:
   - **Apollo Server** is an abstraction over the HTTP server that provides specialized handling for GraphQL requests. You could technically just use Express for everything, but Apollo simplifies GraphQL.
   - **WebSocket Server** is needed for handling real-time data. Since WebSocket is a different protocol (persistent connection), it requires a different setup than HTTP (which is request/response-based).

### Visual Breakdown:
- **HTTP Server**:
  - Serves HTTP traffic (REST, static files, GraphQL queries/mutations).
  - Base layer for both Apollo and WebSocket.

- **Apollo Server**:
  - Attached to the HTTP server.
  - Handles GraphQL queries and mutations (e.g., fetching data).
  - Operates in the traditional request/response cycle (stateless).

- **WebSocket Server**:
  - Also attached to the HTTP server.
  - Handles persistent WebSocket connections for real-time GraphQL subscriptions.
  - Keeps connections open for real-time updates (e.g., chat, notifications).

### Summary:
- **HTTP Server**: General-purpose web server for handling HTTP traffic.
- **Apollo Server**: A GraphQL server layer that processes and responds to GraphQL queries/mutations.
- **WebSocket Server**: Manages WebSocket connections for real-time communication (GraphQL subscriptions, etc.).

Each of these servers plays a specific role in your application to handle different types of communication efficiently.
